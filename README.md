Welcome to the next generation of Reebok's digital shopping experience! This platform seamlessly blends performance, style, and user experience to deliver an exceptional online shopping journey.


Reebok: A Legacy of Innovation and Fitness
Reebok International Limited is a global sportswear brand known for its high-performance footwear, apparel, and fitness gear. Founded in 1895 in Bolton, England, as J.W. Foster and Sons, the company pioneered spiked running shoes. In 1958, it was rebranded as Reebok, inspired by the name of an African antelope.

Reebok gained global recognition in the 1980s with the rise of aerobics and fitness culture, introducing iconic shoes like Freestyle, The Pump, and Classic Leather. It became a powerhouse in athletic footwear, competing with brands like Nike and Adidas. In 2005, Adidas acquired Reebok for $3.8 billion, but the brand struggled under its ownership. In 2021, it was sold to Authentic Brands Group (ABG) for $2.5 billion, aiming to revive its market dominance.

Reebok is known for its cutting-edge innovations like The Pump Technology, ZigTech, Floatride Foam, and Flexweave. It has collaborated with UFC, Les Mills, and CrossFit, making a strong mark in fitness training. The brand has also partnered with athletes and celebrities like Shaquille O’Neal, Allen Iverson, Cardi B, and Victoria Beckham, expanding its influence into fashion and streetwear.

Today, Reebok focuses on sustainability, retro sneaker revivals, and lifestyle fashion, blending its rich heritage with modern trends. Under Authentic Brands Group, it continues to evolve, staying relevant in both sports and casual wear markets.
